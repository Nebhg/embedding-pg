Cook until evenly browned, stirring to break up large lumps. Drain excess grease from the beef and place in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the vegetable mixture over the beef, then arrange the potato slices over the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cheese over the top.\nBake uncovered for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and the dish is heated through and bubbly.\n\nNutrition:\nCalories: 471 kcal\nCarbohydrate Content: 49 g\nCholesterol Content: 70 mg\nFiber Content: 7 g\nProtein Content: 26 g\nSaturated Fat Content: 9 g\nSodium Content: 562 mg\nSugar Content: 2 g\nFat Content: 20 g\nUnsaturated Fat Content: 0 g\n\nImage: https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/DmRjpWZj8SNXTELNzlRy9GAkIbU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/5006412-i-dont-know-Cail-Boo-4x3-1-dc4f03527f064e51892e3357443b0681.jpg","content_tokens":442,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Turducken","total_time":300,"yields":"24 servings","ingredients":["1 (3 pound) whole chicken, boned","salt and pepper to taste","Creole seasoning to taste","1 (4 pound) duck, boned","1 (16 pound) turkey, boned","3 cups prepared sausage and oyster dressing"],"nutrition":{"calories":"836 kcal","carbohydrateContent":"5 g","cholesterolContent":"262 mg","fiberContent":"0 g","proteinContent":"79 g","saturatedFatContent":"16 g","sodiumContent":"360 mg","sugarContent":"1 g","fatContent":"53 g","unsaturatedFatContent":"0 g"},"instructions_list":["Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
